# Data Analytics in Mental Health Care Project

## Overview
This project aims to leverage data analytics techniques to gain insights into mental health care. By analyzing relevant datasets, we seek to understand patterns, trends, and correlations that can inform decision-making processes in mental health treatment and support.

## Motivation
Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being, yet it often faces stigma and lack of attention in healthcare systems. By applying data analytics methodologies, we aim to:

- Identify factors contributing to mental health issues.
- Explore correlations between various demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors and mental health outcomes.
- Develop predictive models for early detection and intervention.
- Optimize resource allocation for mental health services.

## Data Sources
We utilize diverse datasets from reputable sources, including but not limited to:
- National surveys on mental health
- Clinical records from healthcare institutions
- Social media and online forums
- Environmental and socioeconomic data

## Methodology
Our analytical approach includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions, identify outliers, and uncover initial insights.
- Feature Engineering to extract meaningful features from raw data.
- Statistical Analysis to identify correlations and associations between variables.
- Machine Learning techniques such as classification, regression, and clustering to build predictive models and segment populations.
- Visualization to communicate findings effectively.

## Technologies Used
- Python: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- Data visualization libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis and documentation
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
